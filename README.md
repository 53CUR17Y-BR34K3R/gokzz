WHALE-PHISH is a tool that will help you do Phishing in advance way so no one check and identify that you are you doing phishing.
For those guys who Doesn't know about Phishing let me explain "Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords, by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Typically carried out by email spoofing, instant messaging and text messaging, phishing often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website which matches the look and feel of the legitimate site."
This Projetc Does not Promote any thing Like this we just have made for testing perpose dont thing we into any illegal thing.
we guys have add a feature of custom link so the normal link of ngrok that will change in to different link in the tool it self and you can customise that link also like you can make https://google.com/gvbrvbtfg/ftps.io
That way no one will caught that you are phishing
Hope you guys like this Project,then dont forget to give it a like.
